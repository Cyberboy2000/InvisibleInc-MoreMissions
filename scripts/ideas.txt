Distress Call
Reward: New agent or money reward for rescuing contact.
Fluff: Beam in to extract a live asset who got free on their own (agent or civilian type NPC carrying random valuable gear, corporate intel, or similar).
Design: Mission starts at or shortly before alarm level 4. On turn 2, you "establish uplink" with an new agent who you now control, freshly spawned in in a safe location far from the exit. Objective is to get everyone to the exit (+ the usual, safes etc.). Guaranteed 'agent location detected' event one turn later. To compensate, agent starts with some basic gear.


Sabotage
Reward: Partial reward: Money. Full completion reward: Global decline by 1 of target security level? Can we do that?
Fluff: Something about using a massive EMP detonation to scramble the data on some very important servers which is used for security algorithms... Monst3r has arranged for an EMP device to be on site.
Design: First you have to locate the custom EMP pack (can we make it a prop with EMP qualities so it's not sellable?) from a locker (or random safe?), hack the database/server to disable its failsafes, then plant the device. The EMP effect is map-wide and causes Short-Circuit V.2.0 (or something analogous) to install.
Partial completion reward: You can steal corporate intel.

Improvised chat:
Shirsh about Sabotage: "Then it should spawn late, also mayber it could affect single corp only, or area in radius? 
Early it'll lower loot. But later it harder to see difference between levels.
Also, there was a virus usb scenario in Alpha: retrieve the virus, upload the virus
can't we go same: retrieve a master key usb, then hack terminal than initiate shutdown by using usb at special device
with same thunders and bolts as with emp option"
