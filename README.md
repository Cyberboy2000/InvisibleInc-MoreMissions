The aim of this mod is to add new kinds of missions to the game. 

## Installation

If you're looking to playtest the mod, see the [Wiki/Installation](https://github.com/Mobbstar/InvisibleInc-MoreMissions/wiki/1.-Installation).
**You can download the .rar file containing the most recent full build of the mod** from the Releases tab on the right, and unzip it into your Mods folder. This version is largely up to date but may not include recent minor updates.

This mod requires [Sim Constructor by Cyberboy2000](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=580661011) and [Function Library by wodzu_93](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1745350836).

For the Github-savvy:

Download the files. If you intend to contribute, or update frequently, consider installing git on your computer and creating a local branch to pull to. (It's pretty straight-forward, look up some tutorials. I recommend using the "git GUI" application where possible.)

You may need to compile some files before the game can run this mod.
scripts.zip - Simply but all the contents of the "scripts" directory directly into a zip file with the same name.
KWAD files - Run the KWAD builder to generate a fresh KWAD file from the raw assets in this repository. View the official modding tutorials for more information.

## Content

A summary of the currently implemented missions, as well as more detailed installation instructions, can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/Mobbstar/InvisibleInc-MoreMissions/wiki).

## Contribution

In order to contribute to this repository directly, you need to [make a GitHub account](https://github.com/login).

Then pester a "Maintainer" member of this project to give you the Developer role.
If you are confident with git, you can instead make a fork to work in and send a merge request later.

Finally you can edit and upload files via the website, or you use the git client as mentioned in [Installation](#Installation).

Command line instructions for the git client

```
git config --global user.name "My Username"
git config --global user.email "myaddress@jmail.com"
```
